# Cost-efficient model selection example
def choose_model_by_task(task_complexity):
    if task_complexity == "simple":
        return "gpt-4o-mini"  # $0.15/$0.60 per 1M tokens
    elif task_complexity == "medium":
        return "claude-3.5-sonnet"  # $3/$15 per 1M tokens
    else:
        return "claude-4-opus"  # $15/$75 per 1M tokens
```

### 2. Batch Processing Utilization

```python
# Example of reducing duplicate processing with cache
import hashlib
from functools import lru_cache

@lru_cache(maxsize=1000)
def cached_llm_request(prompt_hash):
    # Cache LLM API calls
    return call_llm_api(prompt_hash)
```
