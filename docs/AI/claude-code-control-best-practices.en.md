## What is Claude Code's Autonomous Problem?

### Common Issues

When using Claude Code, you may encounter these "overly autonomous" problems:

- ‚úã **Ignoring instructions and changing code arbitrarily**
- ‚úã **Editing more files than necessary**
- ‚úã **Not following coding conventions**
- ‚úã **Committing without running tests**
- ‚úã **Changing important settings without approval**

!!! warning "Risks of Autonomy"
    Claude Code is a powerful tool, but without control, it may make unexpected changes. Setting up appropriate control mechanisms is crucial.

### Why Autonomous Problems Occur

1. **Insufficient Context**: Project rules are not adequately communicated
2. **Vague Instructions**: Lack of specificity leads to Claude's independent judgment
3. **Configuration Issues**: Incomplete CLAUDE.md file settings
4. **Permission Settings**: Inappropriate use of auto-approval mode

## Control with CLAUDE.md Files

### What is CLAUDE.md?

CLAUDE.md is a special file that Claude Code automatically loads into context. By defining project rules, constraints, and workflows, you can control Claude's behavior.

### File Placement Locations

```
Project/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ CLAUDE.md              # Project-wide rules
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ CLAUDE.local.md        # Local-specific settings (gitignore recommended)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ src/
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ CLAUDE.md          # src directory-specific rules
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ docs/
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ CLAUDE.md          # docs directory-specific rules
```

### Basic CLAUDE.md Template

```markdown
# CLAUDE.md - Project Control File

## üö® Important Constraints

### Required Approval Items
The following operations **must be confirmed** before execution:
- Adding/removing packages
- Changing configuration files (package.json, tsconfig.json, etc.)
- Database schema changes
- Changes affecting production environment

### Prohibited Actions
- Creating/modifying `.env` files
- Editing files in `node_modules`
- Committing without running tests
- Merging PRs without approval

## üîß Development Workflow

### Command List
```bash
# Start development server
npm run dev

# Run tests
npm run test

# Type check
npm run typecheck

# Fix linting issues
npm run lint:fix

# Build
npm run build
```

### Required Steps
1. Always run `npm run typecheck` after code changes
2. Confirm tests pass
3. Confirm no linting violations
4. Explain changes

## üìù Coding Conventions

### TypeScript
- Use ES modules (import/export), CommonJS (require) is prohibited
- Use destructuring for imports when possible
- Explicitly write type definitions

### React
- Use function components
- Follow Hooks order
- Props type definitions are mandatory

### File Structure
- Components under `src/components/`
- Utilities under `src/utils/`
- Type definitions under `src/types/`

## üß™ Testing Policy

### Test Execution Order
1. Unit tests (Jest)
2. Integration tests (Testing Library)
3. E2E tests (Playwright)

### Required Test Coverage
- New features: 80% or higher
- Important functions: 100%
```

### Advanced Control Settings

```markdown
# Advanced CLAUDE.md Configuration Example

## ü§ñ AI Behavior Control

### Thinking Modes
- Use "think hard" before complex changes
- Use "ultrathink" for architectural changes

### Staged Execution
Execute large changes in the following steps:
1. Present change plan and wait for approval
2. Analyze impact scope
3. Develop testing strategy
4. Gradual implementation

### Auto-approval Restrictions
Disable auto-approval in the following cases:
- Simultaneous changes to multiple files (3 or more)
- Configuration file changes
- Dependency changes

## üîç Quality Checks

### Pre-change Checklist
- [ ] Confirm existing tests pass
- [ ] Confirm no type errors
- [ ] Confirm no linting violations
- [ ] Confirm no security vulnerabilities

### Post-change Checklist
- [ ] Add new tests
- [ ] Update documentation
- [ ] Record changelog
- [ ] Create review request

## üìã Project-specific Rules

### Database
- Migration files must be created manually
- SEED data changes require production environment confirmation

### API
- Endpoint additions require API design document updates
- Maintain backward compatibility

### Security
- Functions requiring authentication must be tested
- User input sanitization is mandatory
```

## Writing Effective Instructions

### Specific and Clear Instructions

**‚ùå Bad Example:**
```
Create login functionality
```

**‚úÖ Good Example:**
```
Create login functionality with the following specifications:

1. Create components/auth/LoginForm.tsx
2. Authentication with email/password
3. Validation: email format check, password 8+ characters
4. Show loading state during submission
5. Implement error handling
6. Create test files simultaneously
7. Run npm run test and npm run typecheck after changes
```

### Specify Constraints and Priorities

```markdown
## Instruction Example: Adding New Feature

### Requirements
- Add user profile editing functionality

### Constraints
- Do not modify existing User component
- Use API endpoint /api/users/:id
- Image upload is out of scope for now

### Priorities
1. Basic editing functionality (name, email)
2. Form validation
3. Error handling
4. Adding tests

### Completion Criteria
- [ ] Form works properly
- [ ] Validation functions
- [ ] Test coverage 80% or higher
- [ ] Type checking passes
```

## Practical Control Techniques

### 1. Staged Approval System

```markdown
# Staged Approval Settings in CLAUDE.md

## Approval Levels

### Level 1 (Auto-executable)
- Style adjustments
- Adding comments
- Minor bug fixes

### Level 2 (Simple Approval)
- Adding new functions
- Extending existing features
- Adding tests

### Level 3 (Detailed Review Required)
- Multiple file changes
- Architectural changes
- Dependency changes
- Configuration file changes

### Level 4 (Mandatory Approval)
- Database schema changes
- Security-related changes
- Changes affecting production environment
```

### 2. Checkpoint Settings

```bash
# .claude/checkpoints.md

## Required Checkpoints

### Before Code Changes
1. Check uncommitted changes with git status
2. Confirm current branch
3. Confirm all tests pass

### During Code Changes
1. Report in advance if changing 3+ files
2. Analyze impact scope when changing important functions
3. Explain reasons when adding new dependencies

### After Code Changes
1. Execute npm run test
2. Execute npm run typecheck
3. Review with git diff
4. Confirm commit message
```

### 3. Auto-approval Mode Control

```javascript
// claude-config.js (configuration example)
module.exports = {
  autoApprove: {
    // File patterns allowed for auto-approval
    allowedFiles: [
      'src/**/*.test.ts',
      'src/**/*.spec.ts',
      'docs/**/*.md'
    ],
    // File patterns blocked from auto-approval
    blockedFiles: [
      'package.json',
      'tsconfig.json',
      '.env*',
      'database/**/*'
    ],
    // Maximum number of files for auto-approval
    maxFiles: 2,
    // Maximum number of changed lines for auto-approval
    maxLines: 50
  }
};
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Problems and Solutions

#### 1. Claude Ignores Instructions

**Cause:**
- Vague CLAUDE.md descriptions
- Multiple conflicting instructions

**Solution:**
```markdown
# CLAUDE.md Improvement Example

## üö® Top Priority Rules (override other instructions)
1. Do not break tests
2. Do not cause type errors
3. Do not change configuration files without approval

## Actions When in Doubt
1. Stop changes
2. Report current situation
3. Request detailed instructions
```

#### 2. Unexpected Changes with Auto-approval

**Cause:**
- Auto-approval scope too broad
- Insufficient checking functionality

**Solution:**
```markdown
# Strengthening Auto-approval Restrictions

## Auto-approval Conditions
Auto-approve only when ALL of the following are met:
- 2 or fewer files changed
- 20 or fewer lines changed
- Test files or documentation only
- Does not include package.json or configuration files

## Confirmation Flow
1. Display changes with git diff
2. Wait 5 seconds
3. Request user confirmation
```

#### 3. Performance Issues

**Cause:**
- CLAUDE.md is too long
- Too much unnecessary information

**Solution:**
```markdown
# CLAUDE.md Optimization

## File Structure Review
- CLAUDE.md: Basic rules only (within 100 lines)
- rules/coding.md: Coding conventions
- rules/workflow.md: Workflow
- rules/security.md: Security-related

## Reference Method
Please refer to [Detailed Coding Conventions](./rules/coding.md).
```

### Error Handling

#### Context Limit Error

```bash
# Error: Context window exceeded

## Solutions
1. Make CLAUDE.md more concise
2. Add unnecessary files to .claudeignore
3. Split project into smaller units
```

#### Permission Error

```bash
# Error: Permission denied

## Solutions
1. Check file permissions
2. Check git configuration
3. Review Claude Code permission settings
```
