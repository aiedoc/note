## Effective Usage

### 1. Prompt Optimization

#### Good Prompt Example
```
Please refactor the following Python code:
- Improve readability
- Optimize performance
- Add error handling
- Add type hints

[Paste code here]

Expected output:
1. Refactored code
2. Explanation of changes
3. Performance improvement details
```

#### Prompt to Avoid
```
Fix this code
[Paste code]
```

### 2. Context Provision

#### Effective Context Setting
```
Project Overview:
- Web application (Flask + React)
- Database: PostgreSQL
- Deployment environment: AWS ECS
- Team size: 5 members

Current challenges:
- Slow API response time (average 2 seconds)
- High memory usage
- Frequent error logs

Target code:
[Paste problematic code]
```

### 3. Step-by-Step Approach

Break down large problems into smaller parts:

```
Step 1: Identify current code issues
Step 2: Analyze performance bottlenecks
Step 3: Create refactoring plan
Step 4: Incremental implementation
Step 5: Testing and benchmarking
```

## Best Practices

### 1. Code Quality Improvement

#### Code Review Request Example
```python
# Please review this code
def process_user_data(users):
    result = []
    for user in users:
        if user['age'] > 18:
            if user['status'] == 'active':
                result.append({
                    'name': user['name'],
                    'email': user['email']
                })
    return result

# Points to check:
# 1. Code readability
# 2. Error handling
# 3. Performance
# 4. Pythonic style
```

### 2. Test-Driven Development Support

```python
# Request for test case creation
"""
Please create test cases based on the following specifications:

Feature: User authentication system
Requirements:
- Login with email and password
- Password must be at least 8 characters
- Account lock feature (30-minute lock after 5 failures)
- JWT token issuance

Test framework: pytest
Mock library: unittest.mock
"""
```

### 3. Debugging and Troubleshooting

#### Effective Debugging Request
```
Error situation:
- Error message: [specific error message]
- When it occurs: [when does it happen]
- Environment: [OS, language version, dependencies]
- Reproduction steps: [step by step]

Related code:
[Code where error occurs]

Log output:
[Related logs]

Expected solution:
1. Identify the cause
2. Suggest fixes
3. Prevention measures
```

### 4. Documentation Generation

```python
# Documentation generation request
"""
Please generate comprehensive documentation for the following class:
- docstring (Google format)
- Usage examples
- API specification (Markdown format)
- Type hints
"""

class UserManager:
    def __init__(self, database_url: str):
        # implementation
        pass
    
    def create_user(self, email: str, password: str) -> dict:
        # implementation
        pass
```

## Advanced Usage Techniques

### 1. Architecture Design Consultation

```
System design consultation:

Requirements:
- Web API with 1 million monthly requests
- Response time < 200ms
- 99.9% availability
- Microservices architecture

Constraints:
- Budget: $1000/month
- Team: 2 frontend, 2 backend developers
- Tech stack: Python, React, AWS

Points to consider:
1. Architecture pattern selection
2. Database design
3. Caching strategy
4. Monitoring and logging strategy
```

### 2. Legacy Code Modernization

```
Legacy code modernization support:

Current situation:
- Language: Python 2.7
- Framework: Django 1.11
- Database: MySQL 5.6
- Test coverage: 30%

Goals:
- Python 3.11
- Django 4.2
- MySQL 8.0
- Test coverage: 80%+

Please propose a phased migration plan.
```

### 3. Performance Optimization

```python
# Performance optimization request
"""
Please improve the performance of the following code:

Current issues:
- Execution time: 5 seconds (target: < 1 second)
- Memory usage: 2GB (target: < 500MB)
- Data volume: 1 million records

Optimization aspects:
1. Algorithm improvement
2. Data structure optimization
3. Parallel processing introduction
4. Memory efficiency improvement
"""

def process_large_dataset(data):
    # Code to be improved
    pass
```

## Common Pitfalls and Solutions

### 1. Unclear Requirements
❌ "Make this code better"
✅ "Improve this code's readability and performance by 20%"

### 2. Insufficient Context
❌ Pasting only code
✅ Explaining project background, constraints, and goals

### 3. Non-incremental Requests
❌ "Rebuild the entire system"
✅ "Let's start with refactoring the authentication part"

## Cost Efficiency Improvement

### 1. Prompt Optimization
- Concise and clear instructions
- Remove unnecessary information
- Specify specific output format

### 2. Batch Processing
- Request multiple related tasks together
- Design to complete in one conversation

### 3. Appropriate Model Selection
- Smaller models for simple tasks
- High-performance models for complex tasks

## Future Outlook

Claude Code continues to evolve, with more advanced features expected:
- Longer context windows
- Improved reasoning capabilities
- New tool integration features

By effectively utilizing Claude Code, developers can achieve more efficient and high-quality software development.
