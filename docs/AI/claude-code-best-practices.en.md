[Paste code]
```

### 2. Context Provision

#### Effective Context Setting
```
Project Overview:
- Web application (Flask + React)
- Database: PostgreSQL
- Deployment environment: AWS ECS
- Team size: 5 members

Current challenges:
- Slow API response time (average 2 seconds)
- High memory usage
- Frequent error logs

Target code:

```

### 3. Step-by-Step Approach

Break down large problems into smaller parts:

```
Step 1: Identify current code issues
Step 2: Analyze performance bottlenecks
Step 3: Create refactoring plan
Step 4: Incremental implementation
Step 5: Testing and benchmarking
```

## Best Practices

### 1. Code Quality Improvement

#### Code Review Request Example
```python
# Please review this code
def process_user_data(users):
    result = []
    for user in users:
        if user['age'] > 18:
            if user['status'] == 'active':
                result.append({
                    'name': user['name'],
                    'email': user['email']
                })
    return result

# Points to check:
# 1. Code readability
# 2. Error handling
# 3. Performance
# 4. Pythonic style
```

### 2. Test-Driven Development Support

```python
# Request for test case creation
"""
Please create test cases based on the following specifications:

Feature: User authentication system
Requirements:
- Login with email and password
- Password must be at least 8 characters
- Account lock feature (30-minute lock after 5 failures)
- JWT token issuance

Test framework: pytest
Mock library: unittest.mock
"""
```

### 3. Debugging and Troubleshooting

#### Effective Debugging Request
```
Error situation:
- Error message: [specific error message]
- When it occurs: [when does it happen]
- Environment: [OS, language version, dependencies]
- Reproduction steps: [step by step]

Related code:
[Code where error occurs]

Log output:
[Related logs]

Expected solution:
1. Identify the cause
2. Suggest fixes
3. Prevention measures
```

### 4. Documentation Generation

```python
# Documentation generation request
"""
Please generate comprehensive documentation for the following class:
- docstring (Google format)
- Usage examples
- API specification (Markdown format)
- Type hints
"""

class UserManager:
    def __init__(self, database_url: str):
        # implementation
        pass
    
    def create_user(self, email: str, password: str) -> dict:
        # implementation
        pass
```

## Advanced Usage Techniques

### 1. Architecture Design Consultation

```

- Test coverage: 80%+

Please propose a phased migration plan.
```

### 3. Performance Optimization

```python
# Performance optimization request
"""
Please improve the performance of the following code:

Current issues:
- Execution time: 5 seconds (target: < 1 second)
- Memory usage: 2GB (target: < 500MB)
- Data volume: 1 million records

Optimization aspects:
1. Algorithm improvement
2. Data structure optimization
3. Parallel processing introduction
4. Memory efficiency improvement
"""

def process_large_dataset(data):
    # Code to be improved
    pass
```

## Controlling Over-Autonomous Claude Code and Rule Compliance

As Claude Code becomes more sophisticated, issues may arise where it operates beyond specified scope or ignores established rules. Here are strategies to address these problems.

### 1. Clear Boundary Setting

#### Effective Constraint Specification
```
【Clear Work Scope】
- Target for changes: authentication.py file only
- Forbidden changes: Never touch database.py, config.py
- Existing tests: Must not break
- New features: Not to be added this time

【Specific Constraint Examples】
❌ "Improve the code"
✅ "Add error handling to the login_user function in authentication.py only. Do not modify any other files or functions."
```

### 2. Enforcing Rule Compliance

#### Staged Confirmation Process
```
【Staged Approach】
Step 1: Propose changes only (before implementation)
Step 2: Review and approve proposed changes
Step 3: Implement only approved changes

【Verification Points】
- Are there changes to files other than specified?
- Is existing functionality being broken?
- Are only requested features implemented?
```

### 3. Scope Limitation Techniques

#### Specific Limitation Methods
```python
# Example of scope limitation
"""
Please strictly adhere to the following constraints:

【Allowable Changes】
- File: user_service.py only
- Functions: create_user, update_user only
- Additions allowed: New helper functions (within user_service.py only)

【Prohibited Changes】
❌ Database schema changes
❌ Changes to other service classes
❌ Configuration file changes
❌ Test file changes

【Requested Features Only】
✅ Add validation functionality
✅ Improve error handling
"""
```

### 4. Preventing Over-optimization

#### Appropriate Constraint Setting
```
【Optimization Limitation Specification】
"Performance improvements are not requested. Focus only on readability and maintainability."

【Instructions to Avoid】
❌ "Optimize the code"
❌ "Make the code better"

【Recommended Instructions】
✅ "Make variable names clearer (do not change logic)"
✅ "Add comments (do not change functionality)"
```

### 5. Staged Work Management

#### Requests in Small Units
```
【Request Too Large】
❌ "Refactor the entire authentication system"

【Appropriate Division】
✅ Stage 1: "Add error handling to login function"
✅ Stage 2: "Improve session management in logout function"  
✅ Stage 3: "Separate password validation logic"

【Verification at Each Stage】
- Functional verification
- Code review completion
- Explicit permission for next stage
```

### 6. Output Format Control

#### Specific Output Specification
```
【Output Format Specification】
"Please respond in the following format:
1. Summary of changes (within 3 lines)
2. List of files to be changed
3. Changed code only (no explanations needed)
4. Test method (one command only)

Additional suggestions or improvements are not needed this time."
```

### 7. Emergency Stop Methods

#### Work Interruption Instructions
```
【Interruption Instruction Example】
"STOP: Please interrupt current work.
Reason: More changes than expected are occurring
Request: Please provide steps to revert changes made so far"

【Enhanced Constraints on Restart】
"When restarting, strictly follow:
- Change one file at a time
- Verify functionality after each change
- Proceed to next step only with my explicit permission"
```

## Common Pitfalls and Solutions

### 1. Unclear Requirements
❌ "Make this code better"
✅ "Improve this code's readability and performance by 20%"

### 2. Insufficient Context
❌ Pasting only code
✅ Explaining project background, constraints, and goals

### 3. Non-incremental Requests
❌ "Rebuild the entire system"
✅ "Let's start with refactoring the authentication part"

## Cost Efficiency Improvement

### 1. Prompt Optimization
- Concise and clear instructions
- Remove unnecessary information
- Specify specific output format

### 2. Batch Processing
- Request multiple related tasks together
- Design to complete in one conversation

### 3. Appropriate Model Selection
- Smaller models for simple tasks
- High-performance models for complex tasks

## Future Outlook

Claude Code continues to evolve, with more advanced features expected:
- Longer context windows
- Improved reasoning capabilities
- New tool integration features

By effectively utilizing Claude Code, developers can achieve more efficient and high-quality software development.
